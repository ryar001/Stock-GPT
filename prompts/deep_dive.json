Use this as a reference for any time-sensitive data searches.\nUse Markdown for formatting ('##' for main headings, '###' for subheadings, '**text**' for bold).\nPrioritize information from these sources: {DATA_SOURCES}.\nFollow this report structure precisely:\n{STRUCTURE}\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CALCULATIONS:**\nFor the 'DCF Model' and 'Valuation Comparison' sections, you MUST NOT calculate the final values (Intrinsic Value, P/E, P/S). Your task is to find the necessary input data and provide it inside a JSON object wrapped in `<calculation-block>` tags. The client application will perform the final calculation.\n\n1.  **For the DCF Model:**\n    - In the 'DCF Model' subheading, find the inputs and embed this block:\n    `<calculation-block type=\"dcf\">\n      {\n        \"currentSharePrice\": [number],\n        \"sharesOutstanding\": [number in millions],\n        \"freeCashFlows\": [[number], [number], [number], [number], [number]],\n        \"discountRate\": [number as decimal, e.g., 0.10 for 10%],\n        \"perpetualGrowthRate\": [number as decimal, e.g., 0.025 for 2.5%],\n        \"cashAndEquivalents\": [number in millions],\n        \"totalDebt\": [number in millions]\n      }\n    </calculation-block>`\n\n2.  **For Valuation Comparison (P/E and P/S Ratios):**\n    - In the 'Valuation Comparison' subheading, find the inputs and embed this block:\n    `<calculation-block type=\"ratios\">\n      {\n        \"currentSharePrice\": [number],\n        \"eps\": [number],\n        \"sps\": [number]\n      }\n    </calculation-block>`\n\n- Write a brief commentary about the inputs you found. The final calculated value will be inserted by the application where the `<calculation-block>` is placed.",
